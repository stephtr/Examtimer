# Testzeit

Many university exams involve three common tasks:
* Displaying the current time without distractions
* Clearly indicating the exam start and end times
* Displaying clarifications that come up during the exam

Traditionally, this is handled by searching online for a website displaying the current time, often running into ads and unnecessary clutter.

*Testzeit* streamlines this process, removing distractions and adding a simple note-taking feature.

This web app is available at https://testzeit.univie.ac.at/
